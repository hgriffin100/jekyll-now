I decided I wanted to start this blog while sat in the passenger seat of our little Clio on the M4 heading east. WordPress would probably be most people's choice but I'd played with Jekyll for work and liked the idea of using that more. The challenge was, could I set one up just using my mobile phone while travelling at 70mph right now? Turns out I could, even with my connection dropping occasionally. Admittedly I didn't do much - I forked the repo, made a few changes and had a site up and running. Thank you H+, GitHub, and Barry Clark!
