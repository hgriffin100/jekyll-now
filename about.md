I create software at STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory to help scientists do great research that benefits you, the UK, and the planet in general. I lead a group of over a dozen amazing software engineers. My group hosts work experience students, paid vacation students, and sandwich/year in industry students. We also recruit apprentices and graduates.


### P.S.

I'm married to Tom who also works at "the lab". I love walking, paddling about in our inflatable canoe, and turning scraps of old clothes into quilts. I met Tom in my first year at university. He taught me to program.
